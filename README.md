<h1 align='center'>Web Scraper</h1>

This is a `web sraper` build with `Python` & `Beautiful Soup`. It scrapes the articles from
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news?) & only returns the articles having 100 or more points.

It takes the number of pages you want to scrape as input & uses the `requests.get()` method to get the requested pages.

After that, it uses `Beautiful Soup` & returns a sorted list of articles which have 100 points or more.

This can be useful if you are in a hurry & want to read the important articles, you won't need to spend a lot of time going
through all the articles out there.
